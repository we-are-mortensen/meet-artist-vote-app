# Artist Vote - Google Meet Add-on

## Project Overview

This is a Next.js project that creates a Google Meet Add-on for a gamified daily artist-guessing round. The host picks today's artist from a shared participants table; everyone else picks themselves once (identity stays in `sessionStorage`) and then votes for who they think today's artist is. After the host reveals the answer, a Dixit-inspired scoring rule awards points and the main stage cycles to a leaderboard.

**Important Context:**
- All code and comments are in English
- All user-facing content must be in Catalan
- The poll question is about who is today's artist ("Qui és l'artista d'avui?" in Catalan)
- Poll options come from the shared `participants` table — same source feeds the host's artist dropdown, the voter's option list, and the identity picker
- Voting is identified: every vote stores `voter_participant_id` and `voted_for_id`
- Scoring rules live server-side in the `score_poll` RPC; tunable constants are SQL-side

## Technology Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 16.0.5 (App Router)
- **Runtime**: React 19.2.0
- **Language**: TypeScript 5
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4, PostCSS
- **Google Meet SDK**: @googleworkspace/meet-addons ^1.2.0
- **Real-time Communication**: Supabase Realtime (Broadcast for poll events + Postgres Changes on `participants`)
- **Database**: Supabase Postgres (`participants`, `polls`, `votes`, `score_events`) + `score_poll` RPC for scoring
- **Build Tool**: Next.js with Turbopack

## Key Configuration

### Constants ([src/shared/constants.ts](src/shared/constants.ts))

```typescript
// Google Cloud Project identifier
export const CLOUD_PROJECT_NUMBER = '315905898182';

// Base URL (switches based on debug mode)
export const SITE_BASE = inDebugMode()
  ? 'https://localhost:3000'
  : 'https://we-are-mortensen.github.io/meet-artist-vote-app';

// URL endpoints
export const MAIN_STAGE_URL = SITE_BASE + '/mainstage';
export const SIDE_PANEL_URL = SITE_BASE + '/sidepanel';
export const ACTIVITY_SIDE_PANEL_URL = SITE_BASE + '/activitysidepanel';
```

Debug mode is controlled by environment variable: `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_DEBUG === '1'`

### Supabase Configuration

The app uses Supabase for both data (participants/polls/votes/scoring) and Realtime (Broadcast + Postgres Changes). Required environment variables in `.env`:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_DEFAULT_KEY=your-anon-key
```

**Row-Level Security** is enabled by `supabase/migrations/0006_enable_rls.sql`. Anon can read all
game tables and insert/update `polls` + `votes` from the browser; it has no direct write to
`participants`/`score_events` — `score_poll` is `SECURITY DEFINER` and writes those as the owner.
Realtime keeps working because the `select` policies let anon receive Postgres Changes on
`participants`/`votes`/`polls`. If you add a new client-side write, it needs a matching policy.

## Google Meet Add-on Architecture

### Four Main Components

1. **Screenshare Landing Page** ([src/app/page.tsx](src/app/page.tsx))
   - Entry point for installing/opening the add-on
   - Uses `meet.addon.screensharing.exposeToMeetWhenScreensharing()`
   - Opens side panel for activity setup
   - `startActivityOnOpen: false` - requires manual start

2. **Side Panel** ([src/app/sidepanel/page.tsx](src/app/sidepanel/page.tsx))
   - Shown to the host for setup
   - Loads the full participant list from the Supabase `participants` table
   - Single dropdown ("Qui és l'artista d'avui?") to pick today's artist
   - "Començar votació" inserts a new row into `polls` (status `voting`, `correct_participant_id` set), then calls `MeetSidePanelClient.startActivity()` with:
     - `mainStageUrl` / `sidePanelUrl`
     - `additionalData`: JSON `PollState` containing `pollId`, `correctParticipantId`, and the snapshot of `participants`
   - **Host Detection**: Sets `sessionStorage.setItem('hostOfPollId', pollId)` before redirecting to the activity side panel

3. **Activity Side Panel** ([src/app/activitysidepanel/page.tsx](src/app/activitysidepanel/page.tsx))
   - Shown to all participants during the activity
   - First-load flow: `IdentityPicker` (dropdown + confirm button) lets the participant pick themselves from the participants table. Result stored under `localStorage` key `artistVote.identity` so identity persists across Meet sessions.
   - Returning visitor (identity already in storage) skips the picker. Persistent `IdentityHeader` displays their name + live points, subscribing to Postgres Changes on `participants` so points update without reloads.
   - Every participant — including today's artist — sees the same `OptionList` voting UI. Submitting upserts a row into `votes` keyed by `(poll_id, voter_participant_id)` — "last vote wins" until the host reveals. **Artist exception:** if the voter's identity matches `polls.correct_participant_id`, the client renders the confirmation screen but skips the broadcast and the DB write, so the artist's screen is indistinguishable from anyone else's without leaking a vote.
   - **Host-only controls** (visible when `sessionStorage.getItem('hostOfPollId') === pollId`): two sequential buttons. "Revelar resultats" flips `polls.status` to `revealed` and broadcasts `REVEAL_RESULTS`; "Mostrar puntuació" calls the `score_poll` RPC and broadcasts `SHOW_LEADERBOARD`.
   - Voting cuts off at reveal — late voters get a closed state.

4. **Main Stage** ([src/app/mainstage/page.tsx](src/app/mainstage/page.tsx))
   - Large screen view shown to all participants
   - Creates `MeetMainStageClient` and reads `additionalData` (`pollId`, `correctParticipantId`, `participants`) via `getActivityStartingState()`
   - Three-state router: `voting` (live `VotingProgress` count) → `results` (`ResultsView` with correct artist + correct-guessers highlight) → `leaderboard` (`LeaderboardView`, sorted standings with animated `+N` deltas).
   - Cold-start: after parsing `additionalData`, fetches `polls.status` from Supabase and syncs the view (handles late joiners arriving mid-round or post-reveal).
   - Subscribes to the Supabase Realtime channel for `VOTE_CAST`, `REVEAL_RESULTS`, and `SHOW_LEADERBOARD` events, and to Postgres Changes on `participants` so live point updates flow through to the leaderboard.

### Current Implementation

The app implements a gamified daily round of "Qui és l'artista d'avui?":
- **Poll Setup**: Host loads participants from Supabase and picks today's artist from a dropdown; pressing "Començar votació" creates a `polls` row and starts the activity
- **Identity**: Each participant picks themselves once on first load via a dropdown; identity persists in `localStorage` so it survives the Meet iframe being torn down between calls, and drives the live points header
- **Voting**: Identified votes (`voter_participant_id`, `voted_for_id`); the artist sees the same voting UI as everyone else, but their submit is short-circuited client-side (no DB write, no broadcast) so observers can't spot the artist by walking through identities
- **Two-stage Reveal**: Host first reveals the correct answer + the list of correct guessers; then triggers scoring, which transitions the main stage to a leaderboard
- **Scoring**: Server-side `score_poll` RPC implements Dixit-adapted rules with SQL-tunable constants; results are persisted via `score_events` rows and aggregated on `participants.points`
- **Data Flow**: Supabase Realtime Broadcast for poll events + Postgres Changes on `participants` for live point updates
- **Host Detection**: `sessionStorage` (`hostOfPollId`) tracks which browser tab started the poll

## Development Setup

### Installation
```bash
npm install
```

### Running Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
# Runs on https://localhost:3000 when NEXT_PUBLIC_DEBUG=1
```

### Building for Production
```bash

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_DEFAULT_KEY` - Supabase anonymous/public key

## Key Features

### Participants Table
- **Source of truth**: the `participants` table in Supabase — columns `id` (uuid), `name` (text), `points` (int, default 0), `created_at` (timestamptz).
- **Managed manually in Supabase Studio.** There is no admin UI inside the add-on.
- **One list, three uses**: the same `participants` rows feed the host's artist dropdown (sidepanel), the voting options shown to every other participant (activity side panel), and the identity picker each participant sees on first load.

### Voting System
- **Identified votes**: every row in `votes` stores `poll_id`, `voter_participant_id`, `voted_for_id`, and a timestamp. There is no anonymous fallback.
- **Artist exception**: the participant whose identity matches `polls.correct_participant_id` sees the same voting UI as everyone else, but their submit is short-circuited client-side — the local `hasVoted` state flips and the "Has votat per X" confirmation renders, but no row is written to `votes` and no `VOTE_CAST` event is broadcast. This keeps the artist's screen indistinguishable from any other participant's so observers can't snoop the answer by walking through identities. The host should still avoid picking themselves as the artist (see Host vs artist note below).
- **One vote per voter per poll**: the table has a unique constraint on `(poll_id, voter_participant_id)`. Submissions UPSERT, so "last vote wins" until reveal.
- **Cutoff**: once the host flips `polls.status` to `revealed`, the activity panel shows the closed state and stops accepting changes.

### Results Display
- **Two-stage reveal**, driven by two separate host buttons.
- **Stage 1 — "Revelar resultats"**: the main stage swaps to `ResultsView`, showing the correct artist, the aggregate vote breakdown, and a "Qui ho ha encertat:" list of the participants who guessed correctly.
- **Stage 2 — "Mostrar puntuació"**: the server-side `score_poll(poll_id)` RPC runs (Dixit-adapted rules; constants live in the SQL function so they can be tuned without a redeploy), `participants.points` is updated, and the main stage transitions to `LeaderboardView` — sorted standings with `+N` deltas animated in via Postgres Changes on `participants`.

### Host Detection System
The app uses `sessionStorage` to reliably identify the activity host:
1. When the initiator clicks "Començar votació" in sidepanel, the `pollId` is saved to sessionStorage as `hostOfPollId`
2. After redirect to activitysidepanel, the stored `pollId` is compared with the current poll's ID
3. If they match, the user is the host and sees host-only features (the "Revelar resultats" and "Mostrar puntuació" buttons)
4. This approach handles multiple activities in the same browser session correctly

**Host vs artist:** The host should not pick themselves as today's artist. The artist sees the regular voting UI and their submit is silently dropped, so if the host is also the artist their first submit won't actually do anything beyond unlocking the local "Has votat" branch where the host buttons live — they'll still appear, but the artist's vote (the host's own "real" vote) was never recorded. Either pick a different artist or have a second host identity ready.

### Data Flow
```
Setup Side Panel (host)
  ↓ load participants from DB
  ↓ pick artist
  ↓ INSERT INTO polls (status='voting')
  ↓ startActivity({additionalData: {pollId, correctParticipantId, participants}})
  ↓ sessionStorage.hostOfPollId = pollId
Activity Side Panel
  ↓ IdentityPicker (first time, dropdown) → localStorage.artistVote.identity
  ↓ IdentityHeader (live points via Postgres Changes)
  ↓ everyone sees the same vote UI (artist included)
  ↓ vote: non-artist → UPSERT votes (voter, votedFor, ts), broadcast VOTE_CAST
  ↓        artist     → no DB write, no broadcast (local UI only)
  ↓ host reveals: UPDATE polls.status='revealed', broadcast REVEAL_RESULTS
  ↓ host shows points: rpc score_poll(pollId), broadcast SHOW_LEADERBOARD
Main Stage
  ↓ state machine: voting → results → leaderboard
  ↓ subscribes to Postgres Changes on participants for live points
```

### Supabase Realtime Integration

The app combines two Supabase Realtime modes:

- **Tables**: `participants`, `polls`, `votes`, `score_events`. `participants` is included in the `supabase_realtime` publication so Postgres Changes (CDC) on `points` fan out to every client.
- **Broadcast channel**: `poll-votes-${pollId}` — kept from the previous design, still isolates poll sessions, but now carries three event types:
  - `VOTE_CAST` — sent by voters after a successful upsert; the main stage uses it to update the live count.
  - `REVEAL_RESULTS` — sent by the host's first button; transitions every client to the reveal screen.
  - `SHOW_LEADERBOARD` — sent by the host's second button after `score_poll` returns; transitions the main stage to the leaderboard.
- **useVoteChannel hook** ([src/hooks/useVoteChannel.ts](src/hooks/useVoteChannel.ts)): subscribes/publishes to the broadcast channel, exposes typed send helpers and receive callbacks, and cleans up on unmount.
